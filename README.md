# Netrunner

TODO: Write a gem description

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'netrunner'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install netrunner

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Development

Install the gem dependencies:

    $ bundle

Run the specs via the built-in rake task:

    $ bin/rake

From here you can add a spec and implement the feature. This library
is setup to developed tests first and rapid feedback is available via
[guard](https://github.com/guard/guard). A good way to use guard is
with guard running while actively developing. A simple setup might be
one shell running guard and another that edits files. To run guard:

    $ bin/guard

While guard is running it will auto detect file changes and rerun
the corresponding specs (as defined in the `Guardfile`).

My preferred method is to run guard in a left vertical pane and edit
files in a right vertical pane.
